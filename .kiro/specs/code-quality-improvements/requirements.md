# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses code quality issues in the Godot web export HTML file to improve maintainability, performance, and standards compliance. The improvements focus on modern HTML5 practices, CSS organization, JavaScript best practices, and error handling.

## Glossary

- **CDATA**: Character Data sections used in XHTML for script content
- **HTML5**: Modern HTML standard that doesn't require CDATA sections
- **Memory Leak**: Unintended retention of memory references causing performance degradation
- **Inline Styles**: CSS written directly in HTML elements rather than external stylesheets
- **Strict Equality**: JavaScript === operator for type-safe comparisons
- **CSS Variables**: Custom properties for reusable values in CSS
- **Resource Loading**: Process of fetching and initializing game assets

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the HTML to follow modern HTML5 standards, so that the code is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTML document is parsed, THE System SHALL remove unnecessary CDATA sections from script tags
2. THE System SHALL use standard HTML5 script syntax without legacy XHTML constructs
3. THE System SHALL maintain all existing JavaScript functionality after CDATA removal

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JavaScript code to use strict equality comparisons, so that type coercion bugs are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing values in animation callback filtering, THE System SHALL use strict equality operator (===) instead of loose equality (==)
2. WHEN comparing values in animation callback filtering, THE System SHALL use strict inequality operator (!==) instead of loose inequality (!=)
3. THE System SHALL maintain identical filtering behavior after operator changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for resource loading, so that I receive clear feedback when game assets fail to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes, THE System SHALL verify existence of index.pck file before loading
2. WHEN the game initializes, THE System SHALL verify existence of index.wasm file before loading
3. IF resource files are missing, THEN THE System SHALL display informative error message to user
4. THE System SHALL gracefully handle network errors during resource loading

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want CSS separated from HTML, so that styles are cacheable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL extract all inline CSS to external stylesheet file
2. THE System SHALL link external CSS file in HTML head section
3. THE System SHALL maintain identical visual appearance after CSS extraction
4. THE System SHALL preserve all responsive design behaviors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible CSS sizing using modern techniques, so that the interface adapts better to different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE hardcoded pixel values exist, THE System SHALL replace with relative units or CSS variables
2. THE System SHALL define CSS custom properties for reusable dimension values
3. THE System SHALL maintain visual consistency across different viewport sizes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean CSS without duplicated properties, so that the stylesheet is maintainable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS properties are duplicated within same rule, THE System SHALL remove duplicate declarations
2. THE System SHALL preserve the intended visual styling after duplicate removal
3. THE System SHALL validate CSS syntax correctness after cleanup
